# 🎥 Ongoing Personal Project

Embarking on this journey post-School of Code, I proudly present my self-initiated endeavor:

## 🎬 Cinematic Choice (CC)🎬 

Step into the world of Cinematic Choice (CC), a revolutionary platform designed to empower both ardent movie enthusiasts and passionate independent filmmakers. Our vision is rooted in the enchantment of independent cinema and the captivating narratives that deserve the grandeur of the silver screen. Cinematic Choice puts the reins in the hands of users, allowing them to curate their ideal cinematic experiences by casting their invaluable votes for the independent films that stir their excitement. Our mission is to bridge the chasm between fervent audiences and exceptionally talented filmmakers who lack the backing of traditional distribution channels, thereby reshaping the very landscape of the film industry itself.

Notably distinct from conventional crowdfunding, CC offers a focused haven exclusively for cinema, alleviating the competitiveness that plagues independent filmmakers on general crowdfunding platforms, ensuring that their creations find the right audience without dilution.

## 📌 User Story:
"As a movie enthusiast, I want to support 
and experience independent films on the big screen 
so that I gain inspiration from their unique storytelling approaches."

## 📌 Problems:
In a landscape where traditional distribution is dominant, the accessibility to screenings of undisturbed independent films remains an arduous challenge.

## 📌 Unique Features:
The imminent release of our MVP promises an array of compelling features. Users will be presented with a curated selection of movies, each beckoning for their votes. The process is elegantly streamlined, allowing for the purchase of votes online. Once a film amasses the requisite number of votes, it propels into the next phase—a meticulously arranged screening within a supportive cinema. As a gesture of gratitude, the voters-turned-patrons not only gain exclusive VIP tickets but also receive thoughtfully crafted special gifts, acknowledging their pivotal role in breathing life into these cinematic dreams.

✨Featuring Films:
Each featured film encompasses a brief synopsis, an engaging trailer, evocative stills, an immersive soundtrack, insightful reviews, and a real-time vote count. This holistic approach empowers users to make informed choices and celebrate the essence of independent cinema.

✨Vote Count: 
Elevating the momentum, the live vote count stands as a beacon of significance. It vividly portrays the journey of each film, illuminating how much attention it has received. Equally crucial, it reveals the number of votes required to propel this film to its coveted screening, empowering users with a tangible sense of impact before they cast their decisive votes. 

Join us in this cinematic odyssey! Welcome to Cinematic Choice, where each vote shapes the story of change, frame by frame!
