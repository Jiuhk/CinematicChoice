# 🎥 Ongoing Personal Project 🎥

Embarking on this journey post-School of Code, I proudly present my self-initiated endeavor:

## 🎬 Cinematic Choice (CC)🎬 

Step into the world of Cinematic Choice (CC), a groundbreaking platform empowering movie enthusiasts and independent filmmakers. With a core belief in the magic of independent cinema, CC allows users to curate their cinematic experiences by voting for the films they're excited about. Bridging the gap between audiences and talented filmmakers without traditional distribution, CC reshapes the film industry. Unlike general crowdfunding, CC provides a dedicated space for cinema, sidestepping competition and ensuring filmmakers connect directly with their audience.

Welcome to CC, where every vote transforms the way movies come to life.
